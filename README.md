- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Geek39
I'am currently learning how to use the Coverity static source code analyzer for embedded projects.
These DIY projects are made with ARM Cortex-M evaluation boards from several manufacturers like NXP,
STMicroelectronics, Texas Instruments and Microchip.

I have tried to setup CodeChecker static analyzer on WSL2, but got stuck with library errors.
Linux programs are so dependent from a lot of libraries, that I prefer to work on Windows!

So if any of you have experience with Coverity, just let me know how you have experienced it!
You can reach me at: veenm299@gmail.com

Thanks!
